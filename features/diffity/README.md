# diffity feature

Opt-in feature that builds [diffity](https://github.com/sdirix/diffity) — an
agent-driven, GitHub-style diff review UI — from a **pinned git commit**, inside
the agent image.

Install and enable it:

```bash
enclave features add sdirix/enclave-extensions --name diffity
enclave --features +diffity …
```

Viewing the UI needs the
[vnc feature](https://github.com/eclipse-enclave/enclave-extensions/tree/main/features/vnc)
as well, see [Using it in a session](#using-it-in-a-session).

## What it does

At image build time, `install.sh`:

1. clones diffity and checks out a pinned commit SHA (verifying `git rev-parse
   HEAD` matches), so the build uses exactly the reviewed source rather than the
   mutable npm registry package;
2. runs `npm ci --ignore-scripts` (exact, hash-checked dependency tree, no
   arbitrary lifecycle scripts), then rebuilds `esbuild` (the bundler, whose own
   install step `--ignore-scripts` skips);
3. runs `npm run build` and installs a `diffity` launcher on `PATH`.

Every build step and the installed launcher use the **private agent Node
runtime** (`/opt/enclave/node`), not the session's user-facing `node` — the same
convention every bundled agent tool follows. The user-facing node can be
repointed (the `node-dev` feature aliases its own nvm default; a project `.nvmrc`
selects a version), so pinning keeps diffity on a runtime that meets its declared
Node floor (`>=22.13`) regardless. diffity has no native modules, so this is a
stable-runtime guarantee rather than an ABI requirement. Because the build happens
in this image, **sessions need no npm/registry access at runtime**.

## Using it in a session

`diffity` is on `PATH` for the agent and serves on **container-local**
port 5391 — no host port is published, so the agent-served UI is never loaded
by the host browser. Viewing goes through the `vnc` feature instead: diffity
opens its own UI in the contained Chromium (see below), and the human watches
that display over VNC (see the
[vnc feature](https://github.com/eclipse-enclave/enclave-extensions/tree/main/features/vnc)):

```bash
enclave features add eclipse-enclave/enclave-extensions --name vnc
enclave --features +diffity,+vnc …
# on the host:
enclave vnc-viewer   # opens a viewer on the session's contained display
```

Inside the session, every diffity command that opens a view (`diffity`,
`diffity tree`, `diffity open`) drives the contained Chromium to the right
URL — **including the ref**, so the intended diff and its review session are
shown. This runs through the same `$BROWSER`/`xdg-open` path as any "open in
browser" flow (the vnc feature registers `vnc-open` as the image's http/https
handler, see its README), so the agent's "open in browser" behavior works
unchanged — it just lands on the streamed display instead of a host tab. Until
the first diffity view opens, the display shows the vnc feature's waiting page.
The DB lives in the container's `~/.diffity`, not in the mounted code.

> diffity intentionally opens its own ref-specific URL rather than having the
> vnc feature auto-forward to the server root. A ref-less load (`/`) resolves
> to the working-tree ("work") session and marks it the active session, which
> would clobber the session a skill just opened and hide its comments from the
> `diffity agent` CLI (which follows the active session).

## Bumping diffity

A commit SHA is immutable, so updates are deliberate: review the new commit
**and** its `package-lock.json`, update `DIFFITY_SHA` in `install.sh` (or pass
`DIFFITY_SHA=…` as a build arg), and rebuild.

## Skills

The feature also ships diffity's slash-command skills (`diffity-diff`,
`diffity-review`, `diffity-resolve`, `diffity-tree`, `diffity-resolve-tree`,
`diffity-tour`, `diffity-learn`) under `skills/`. When the feature is enabled,
these are composed into the agent's (read-only) skills mount on the host, so
they are present only for sessions that opted into `--features +diffity`.

The skills are **vendored** from the same diffity revision as `DIFFITY_SHA`,
with one enclave adaptation: upstream's "check your browser / here is the
URL" guidance is reworded to point at the session's VNC viewer, since diffity
serves container-locally and is watched over VNC. When you bump `DIFFITY_SHA`,
refresh the skills and re-apply that wording:

```bash
# from a checkout of diffity at the new SHA:
cp -r skills/* <this-repo>/features/diffity/skills/
# then re-apply the VNC-viewer wording (see git log for the last adaptation)
```
