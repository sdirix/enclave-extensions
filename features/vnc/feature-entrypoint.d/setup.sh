# "open in browser" flows (xdg-open, $BROWSER consumers) land on the contained
# Chromium. The stack itself is started by commands.startup in spec.yaml.

# DISPLAY is process-wide for every tool in the session, which also flips the
# behavior of anything that treats a set DISPLAY as "a GUI is available"
# (pinentry, SSH_ASKPASS, GIT_ASKPASS): those prompts render on the contained
# display instead of the terminal. The feature README documents this.
